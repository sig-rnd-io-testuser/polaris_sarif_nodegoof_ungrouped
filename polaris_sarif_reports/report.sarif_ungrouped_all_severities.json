A successful exploit allows attackers to run arbitrary commands on the host system where the Snyk CLI is installed by passing in crafted command line flags. In order to exploit this vulnerability, a user would have to execute the snyk test command on untrusted files. In most cases, an attacker positioned to control the command line arguments to the Snyk CLI would already be positioned to execute arbitrary commands.

Properly protect the key (CWE-320). If you cannot use encryption to protect the file, then make sure that the permissions are as restrictive as possible [REF-7].\n\nIn Windows environments, the Encrypted File System (EFS) may provide some protection.\n\n  2. For inbound authentication: Rather than hard-code a default username and password, key, or other authentication credentials for first time logins, utilize a \"first login\" mode that requires the user to enter a unique strong password or key.\n  3. If the software must contain hard-coded credentials or they cannot be removed, perform access control checks and limit which entities can access the feature that requires the hard-coded credentials. For example, a feature might only be enabled through the system console instead of through a network connection.\n  4. For inbound authentication using passwords: apply strong one-way hashes to passwords and store those hashes in a configuration file or database with appropriate access control. That way, theft of the file/database still requires the attacker to try to crack the password. When handling an incoming password during authentication, take the hash of the password and compare it to the saved hash.\n\nUse randomly assigned salts for each separate hash that is generated.

This can be accomplished either programmatically when setting Set-Cookie headers in responses or via deployment descriptors provided by various frameworks.\n\nThe setting \"SameSite=Strict\" provides the strongest protection against CSRF but the user experience works best when an application uses two different cookies, one for write-access that is locked down with \"SameSite=Strict\" and another for read-access that can have a more permissive setting, e.g., \"SameSite=Lax\". If the application only relies on one cookie for both read \u0026 write access, then the setting \"SameSite=Lax\" provides some protection against CSRF without too much negative impact on user experience. \n\nIt's worth noting that the definition of same-site is less restrictive than the definition of cross-origin, e.g., requests from other sub-domains are considered same-site although they are from a different origin. This means that even in browsers that fully support the \"SameSite\" cookie attribute, an attacker may still circumvent this protection if they can take over a subdomain or inject HTML or JavaScript into any subdomain of the same site. Therefore, relying on the \"SameSite\" attribute is not recommended as the sole defense against cross-site request forgery, it should instead be seen as a defense in depth mechanism that reduces the likelihood of CSRF.\n\n## References\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-1275](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1275.html)\n\n","text":"The `cookie.sameSite` option is either undefined or set to the insecure value `none` or `false`.

Design throttling mechanisms into the system architecture. The best protection is to limit the amount of resources that an unauthorized user can cause to be expended. A strong authentication and access control model will help prevent such attacks from occurring in the first place. The login application should be protected against DoS attacks as much as possible. Limiting the database access, perhaps by caching result sets, can help minimize the resources expended. To further limit the potential for a DoS attack, consider tracking the rate of requests received from users and blocking requests that exceed a defined rate threshold.\n  2. Mitigation of resource exhaustion attacks requires that the target system either:\n\n    * recognizes the attack and denies that user further access for a given amount of time, or\n    * uniformly throttles all requests in order to make it more difficult to consume resources more quickly than they can again be freed.\n\nThe first of these solutions is an issue in itself though, since it may allow attackers to prevent the use of the system by a particular valid user. If the attacker impersonates the valid user, they may be able to prevent the user from accessing the server in question.\n\nThe second solution is simply difficult to effectively institute -- and even when properly done, it does not provide a full solution.

Design throttling mechanisms into the system architecture. The best protection is to limit the amount of resources that an unauthorized user can cause to be expended. A strong authentication and access control model will help prevent such attacks from occurring in the first place. The login application should be protected against DoS attacks as much as possible. Limiting the database access, perhaps by caching result sets, can help minimize the resources expended. To further limit the potential for a DoS attack, consider tracking the rate of requests received from users and blocking requests that exceed a defined rate threshold.\n  2. Mitigation of resource exhaustion attacks requires that the target system either:\n\n    * recognizes the attack and denies that user further access for a given amount of time, or\n    * uniformly throttles all requests in order to make it more difficult to consume resources more quickly than they can again be freed.\n\nThe first of these solutions is an issue in itself though, since it may allow attackers to prevent the use of the system by a particular valid user.

When the set of filenames is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames, and reject all other inputs. For example, ID 1 could map to \"inbox.txt\" and ID 2 could map to \"profile.txt\". Features such as the ESAPI AccessReferenceMap provide this capability.\n  2. Run your code in a \"jail\" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict all access to files within a particular directory.\n\nExamples include the Unix chroot jail and AppArmor. In general, managed code may provide some protection.\n\nThis may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of your application may still be subject to compromise.\n\nBe careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.\n\n  3. For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.\n  4. Assume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.\n\nWhen performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"\n\nDo not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\n\nWhen validating filenames, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single \".\" character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as \"/\" to avoid CWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434.\n\nDo not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering \"/\" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of \"\\\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if \"../\" sequences are removed from the \".../...//\" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of \"../\" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the \"../\" string.\n\n  5. Use a built-in path canonicalization function (such as realpath() in C) that produces the canonical version of the pathname, which effectively removes \"..\" sequences and symbolic links (CWE-23, CWE-59).\n  6. Use OS-level permissions and run as a low-privileged user to limit the scope of any successful attack.\n  7. If you are using PHP, configure your application so that it does not use register_globals. During implementation, develop your application so that it does not rely on this feature, but be wary of implementing a register_globals emulation that is subject to weaknesses such as CWE-95, CWE-621, and similar issues.\n  8. Use automated static analysis tools that target this type of weakness. Many modern techniques use data flow analysis to minimize the number of false positives. This is not a perfect solution, since 100% accuracy and coverage are not feasible.\n  9. Use dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the software using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The software's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.\n  10. Use tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session. These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules.\n\n## References\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-73](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/73.html)\n\n","text":"The dangerous characters from user-provided file names are not stripped in the `express-fileupload` module.

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.\n\nExamples of libraries and frameworks that make it easier to generate properly encoded output include Microsoft's Anti-XSS library, the OWASP ESAPI Encoding module, and Apache Wicket.\n\n  2. Understand the context in which your data will be used and the encoding that will be expected. This is especially important when transmitting data between different components, or when generating outputs that can contain multiple encodings at the same time, such as web pages or multi-part mail messages. Study all expected communication protocols and data representations to determine the required encoding strategies.\n\nFor any data that will be output to another web page, especially any data that was received from external inputs, use the appropriate encoding on all non-alphanumeric characters.\n\nParts of the same output document may require different encodings, which will vary depending on whether the output is in the:\n\n    * HTML body\n    * Element attributes (such as src=\"XYZ\")\n    * URIs\n    * JavaScript sections\n    * Cascading Style Sheets and style property\n\netc. Note that HTML Entity Encoding is only appropriate for the HTML body.\n\nConsult the XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet [REF-724] for more details on the types of encoding and escaping that are needed.\n\n  3. Understand all the potential areas where untrusted inputs can enter your software: parameters or arguments, cookies, anything read from the network, environment variables, reverse DNS lookups, query results, request headers, URL components, e-mail, files, filenames, databases, and any external systems that provide data to the application. Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls.\n  4. For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.\n  5. If available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between data and code. These mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding, and validation automatically, instead of relying on the developer to provide this capability at every point where output is generated.\n  6. Use and specify an output encoding that can be handled by the downstream component that is reading the output. Common encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8. When an encoding is not specified, a downstream component may choose a different encoding, either by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used, which can be erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might treat some character or byte sequences as special, even if they are not special in the original encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct injection attacks; they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is also being used by the downstream component.\n\nThe problem of inconsistent output encodings often arises in web pages. If an encoding is not specified in an HTTP header, web browsers often guess about which encoding is being used. This can open up the browser to subtle XSS attacks.\n\n  7. With Struts, write all data from form beans with the bean's filter attribute set to true.\n  8. To help mitigate XSS attacks against the user's session cookie, set the session cookie to be HttpOnly. In browsers that support the HttpOnly feature (such as more recent versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox), this attribute can prevent the user's session cookie from being accessible to malicious client-side scripts that use document.cookie. This is not a complete solution, since HttpOnly is not supported by all browsers. More importantly, XMLHTTPRequest and other powerful browser technologies provide read access to HTTP headers, including the Set-Cookie header in which the HttpOnly flag is set.\n  9. Assume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.\n\nWhen performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"\n\nDo not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\n\nWhen dynamically constructing web pages, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set based on the expected value of the parameter in the request. All input should be validated and cleansed, not just parameters that the user is supposed to specify, but all data in the request, including hidden fields, cookies, headers, the URL itself, and so forth. A common mistake that leads to continuing XSS vulnerabilities is to validate only fields that are expected to be redisplayed by the site. It is common to see data from the request that is reflected by the application server or the application that the development team did not anticipate. Also, a field that is not currently reflected may be used by a future developer. Therefore, validating ALL parts of the HTTP request is recommended.\n\nNote that proper output encoding, escaping, and quoting is the most effective solution for preventing XSS, although input validation may provide some defense-in-depth. This is because it effectively limits what will appear in output. Input validation will not always prevent XSS, especially if you are required to support free-form text fields that could contain arbitrary characters. For example, in a chat application, the heart emoticon (\"\u003c3\") would likely pass the validation step, since it is commonly used. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the web page because it contains the \"\u003c\" character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise handled. In this case, stripping the \"\u003c\" might reduce the risk of XSS, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the emoticon would not be recorded. This might seem to be a minor inconvenience, but it would be more important in a mathematical forum that wants to represent inequalities.\n\nEven if you make a mistake in your validation (such as forgetting one out of 100 input fields), appropriate encoding is still likely to protect you from injection-based attacks. As long as it is not done in isolation, input validation is still a useful technique, since it may significantly reduce your attack surface, allow you to detect some attacks, and provide other security benefits that proper encoding does not address.\n\nEnsure that you perform input validation at well-defined interfaces within the application. This will help protect the application even if a component is reused or moved elsewhere.\n\n  10. When the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.\n  11. Use an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness. It can be beneficial in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an emergency prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are applied, or to provide defense in depth.\n  12. When using PHP, configure the application so that it does not use register_globals. During implementation, develop the application so that it does not rely on this feature, but be wary of implementing a register_globals emulation that is subject to weaknesses such as CWE-95, CWE-621, and similar issues.\n\n## References\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)\n\n","text":"Untrusted user-supplied data is inserted into a context that can execute JavaScript without adequate validation, escaping, or filtering."},"properties":{"security-severity":"8.9","tags":["security","static_analysis","external/cwe/cwe-79"]},"defaultConfiguration":{"level":"error"}},{"id":"sigma.verbose_server_banner:express|javascript","shortDescription":{"text":"Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data"},"fullDescription":{"text":"HTTP responses contain an `X-Powered-By` header that reveals information about the server which helps attackers exploit known vulnerabilities or craft more targeted exploits."},"help":{"markdown":"\n## Description\nHTTP responses contain an `X-Powered-By` header that reveals information about the server which helps attackers exploit known vulnerabilities or craft more targeted exploits.\n\n[Click Here To See More Details in Polaris](https://pim.altair.synopsys.com/portfolio/portfolios/fc7e733e-7956-43d0-8d0d-4aa33c4c2ef7/portfolio-items/0c21d02d-1ab1-4c0e-8cad-0a209bf54bf1/projects/acdce967-69ad-4b2d-b077-f96cbd4bc4ff/issues?branchId=defb5564-9d17-4191-b50f-38d67ea9453a\u0026filter=issueType%3Alocalized-name%3DInsertion%20of%20Sensitive%20Information%20Into%20Sent%20Data%26context%3AtoolType%3Dsast)\n\n\n\n## Remediation\nPotential mitigations include the following:\n  1.
